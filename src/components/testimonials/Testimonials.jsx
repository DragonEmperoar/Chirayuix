			comment: "I had the pleasure of working with Chirayu during his internship, and I was thoroughly impressed with his creativity, professionalism, and design skills. His ability to think outside the box and translate concepts into visually stunning graphics truly elevated the projects we worked on. Chirayu met deadlines, communicated effectively, and brought fresh ideas to the table. He was a valuable asset to the team, and his contributions made a lasting impact on the final designs. I have no doubt that Chriayu will continue to excel and make a positive impact in any creative endeavor¬†they¬†pursue.",
